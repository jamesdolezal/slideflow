Tile extraction
===============

Once a validation plan has been established, our next step is tile extraction. To configure our project to extract tiles, uncomment the line with the ``extract_tiles()`` function. The only arguments required are ``tile_px`` and ``tile_um``, which determine the size of the extracted tiles in pixels and microns, respectively:

.. code-block:: python

	SFP.extract_tiles(tile_px=299, tile_um=302)

The documentation for the ``extract_tiles`` function is given below:

.. autofunction:: slideflow.SlideflowProject.extract_tiles
   :noindex:

To filter according to a columns in your annotations file, pass a dictionary to ``filters`` with keys equal to column names and values equal to a list of all acceptable values you want to include. If this argument is not supplied, all valid slides will be extracted.

For example, to extract tiles only for slides that are labeled as "train" in the "dataset" column header in your annotations file, do:

.. code-block:: python

	SFP.extract_tiles(tile_px=299, tile_um=302, filters={"dataset": ["train"]})

To further filter by the annotation header "mutation_status", including only slides with the category "braf" or "ras", do:

.. code-block:: python

	SFP.extract_tiles(tile_px=299, tile_um=302, filters={"dataset": ["train"], "mutation_status": ["braf", "ras"]})

*Note: the "filters" argument can be also used for filtering input slides in many slideflow functions, including train(), evaluate(), generate_heatmaps(), and generate_mosaic().*

To begin tile extraction, save the ``actions.py`` file and run your project as described in :ref:`execute`. 

Tiles will be extracted at the specified pixel and micron size. Tiles will be automatically stored in TFRecord format and separated into training and validation steps if required (necessary when validation data is generated on per-tile basis; see :ref:`validation_planning`).

Normalization
*************

Tiles can be normalized to account for differing strengths of H&E staining, which has been shown to improve machine learning accuracy on some datasets. Several normalization algorithms exist, and none have shown clear superiority over the other. However, while tile normalization may improve training performance, some tiles and slides may be prone to artifacts as a result of normalization algorithms. 

If you choose to use tile normalization, you may either normalize the tile to an internal H&E-stained image contained within the pipeline, or you may explicitly provide a reference image for normalization. 

Normalization can be done on-the-fly or at the time of tile extraction prior to storage in TFRecords. On-the-fly normalization adds significant CPU overhead and is generally not recommended. Normalization can also be done at the time of extraction, which reduces CPU requirements during other pipeline functions. To normalize tiles during extraction, use the ``normalizer`` and ``normalizer_source`` arguments; ``normalizer`` is the name of the algorithm to use, and can include 'macenko', 'reinhard', or 'vahadane'. A path to a normalization reference image may optionally be provided through ``normalizer_source``. 

.. code-block:: python

	SFP.extract_tiles(tile_px=299, tile_um=302, normalizer='macenko')

Alternatively, real-time normalization can be performed with nearly any pipeline function that accepts TFRecord inputs. For example, to normalize tiles during training:

.. code-block:: python

	SFP.train(...,
		normalizer='macenko',
		normalizer_source='/path/to/reference.png')

Whitespace/grayspace filtering
******************************

In order to filter out background tiles, either whitespace or grayspace filtering may be used. Whitespace filtering is performed by calculating overall brightness for each pixel, and counting the fraction of pixels with a brightness above some threshold. Grayspace filtering is performed by convering RGB pixels to the HSV (hue, saturation, value) colorspace, and counting the fraction of pixels with a saturation below some threshold. 

To perform filtering at the time of tile extraction, use the arguments ``whitespace_fraction``, ``whitespace_threshold``, ``grayspace_fraction``, and ``grayspace_threshold``, as described in the documentation, :func:`slideflow.SlideflowProject.extract_tiles`.

Extraction reports
******************

Once tiles have been extracted, a PDF report will be generated with a summary and sample of tiles extracted from their corresponding slides. An example of such a report is given below. It is generally good practice to review this report, as you may catch slides with data corruption, artifacts with stain normalization, or suboptimal whitespace/grayspace filtering. The report is saved in the project root directory.

In addition to viewing reports after tile extraction, you may generate new reports on existing tfrecords with :func:`slideflow.SlideflowProject.tfrecord_report`. You can also generate reports for slides that have not yet been extracted with :func:`slideflow.SlideflowProject.slide_report`.
