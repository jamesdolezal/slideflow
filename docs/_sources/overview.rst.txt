Overview
========

Slideflow provides tools for easily building and testing a variety of deep learning models for digital pathology.

This section provides a high-level overview of the most common application: building and testing a weakly supervised predictive model. Slideflow supports many other tasks, including :ref:`self-supervised learning <simclr_ssl>`, :ref:`generative adversarial networks <stylegan>`, and :ref:`deployment & visualization <workbench>`, which are discussed in subsequent sections.

    *High-level overview of common tasks.*

The pipeline for a deep learning classification experiment is separated into three phases.

1) **Tile extraction** - annotate slides with regions of interest (ROIs) [*optional*] and extract image tiles from whole-slide images.

2) **Model training** - determine model parameters, train a model, and evaluate the model on a held-out test set.

3) **Explainability** - generate predictive heatmaps and analyze learned image features.

A brief introduction to the steps needed to execute a basic experiment is provided below. Each process will be described in more detail in the following sections.

Step 1: Prepare a dataset
*************************

- **Extract tiles**. :ref:`Tiles are extracted <filtering>` from slides at a given magnification size in microns (or a magnification layer, such as "10x"), and saved at a given resolution in pixels. The optimal extraction size in both microns and pixels will depend on your dataset and model architecture. Poor quality tiles - including background tiles or tiles with high whitespace content - can be discarded with quality control methods. Tiles will be stored as TFRecords, a binary file format used to improve dataset reading performance during training. Each slide will have its own TFRecord file containing its extracted tiles.

- **Set aside final evaluation set**. :ref:`Split the dataset <datasets_and_validation>` into a training/validation set and held-out test set.

- **Determing validation plan**. By default, three-fold cross-validation will be performed during training. Many other validation strategies are also supported (:ref:`validation_planning`).

Step 2: Train a model
*********************

- **Choose hyperparameters**. Choose a model architecture (e.g. InceptionV3, VGG16, ResNet, etc.) and a set of hyperparameters (e.g. batch size, learning rate, etc.). This can be done manually, or :ref:`hyperparameters can be optimized <hyperparameter_optimization>` via grid search or Bayesian optimization.

- **Initiate training**. :ref:`Train your model <training>`, taking note of training and validation performance (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, AP, R-squared, C-index).

Step 3: Evaluate the model
**************************

- **Evaluate on held-out set**: :ref:`Evaluate your final model <evaluation>` model on the held-out dataset.

Step 4: Generate heatmaps
*************************

- **Generate heatmaps**: :ref:`Generate heatmaps <generate_heatmaps>` of predictions across slides in the held-out dataset to assist with interpretability.

Step 5: Make a Mosaic map
*************************

- **Generate a mosaic map**: :ref:`Create a mosaic map <mosaic_map>`, which visually illustrates the latent space of your trained model and held-out dataset, to assist with interpretability.

Step 6: Live visualization
**************************
- **Deploy the model**: Finally, use a trained model to visualize predictions for whole-slide images with the interactive tool :ref:`Workbench <workbench>`. This whole-slide image viewer includes deep learning tools enabling you to visualize model predictions on whole-slide images, standard JPG/PNG files, real-time camera feeds, and even Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-generated images.
