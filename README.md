# SlideFlow README

SlideFlow is a Python-based machine learning pipeline for building and testing convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
for use in histology image analysis. It is built using Tensorflow and currently utilizes Googleâ€™s Inception-v4 network
architecture. It includes tools for annotating slides, tessellating image tiles from the slides, organizing training
and evaluation datasets, building and training an Inception-v4 model, and evaluating model performance with ROCs and
whole-slide heatmap overlays. It also includes tools for building mosaic maps, a method of visualizing image features
learned by the trained model.
