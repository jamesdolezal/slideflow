# SlideFlow README

Slideflow is a Python package which aims to provide an easy and intuitive way of building and testing neural network models for use in histology image analysis. It is built using Keras (with Tensorflow backend) and supports many standard network architectures - e.g. InceptionV3, Resnet, and VGG16 - as well as custom architectures.
 
The overarching goal of the package is to provide tools to train and test models on histology slides, apply these models to new slides, and analyze performance by generating predictive heatmaps, ROCs, and mosaic maps.
