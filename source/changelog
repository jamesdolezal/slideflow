- Enabled color escape sequences for Windows Powershell
- Standardized annotation headers compatible with TCGA
- Fixed sfutil bugs
- Added reuse=rf.AUTO_REUSE option to see if model duplication can be avoided (does this reduce model memory footprint)?)

6-1-2019
- Added automatic case name & slide name association
- Fixed single ROI
- Added verification checks to tiles and annotation files
- Added shortname compatibility for TCGA files
- Added delete tiles function
- Organized sfutil module
- Improved performance of tile extraction
- Fixed sfmodel tfrecord cross-compatibility
- Connected sfmodel to use variables from slideflow project (batch size, image size, etc)
- Added on-the-fly augmentation as default
- Improved slide filtering during tile extraction; allows use of annotation file columns

TODO:
- automatic cessation of training upon validation accuracy flattening
- return validation accuracy trough as result of training
- create automatic hyperparameter sweeping based on training results
- manually verify ROI tile extraction (visualize non-augmented tiles and compare to SVS annotation)
