slideflow.io.torch
===================

The purpose of this module is to provide a performant, backend-agnostic TFRecord reader and interleaver to use as
input for PyTorch models. Its TFRecord reader is a modified and optimized version of
https://github.com/vahidk/tfrecord, included as the module :mod:`slideflow.tfrecord`. TFRecord file reading and
interleaving is supervised by :func:`slideflow.io.torch.interleave`, while the
:func:`slideflow.io.torch.interleave_dataloader` function provides a PyTorch DataLoader object which can be directly used.
