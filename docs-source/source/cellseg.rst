Cell Segmentation
=================

Many tasks in digital pathology rely on analysis of cellular features, as opposed to higher-level architectural features. Slideflow supports whole-slide analysis of cellular features with a cell detection and segmentation pipeline based on `Cellpose <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01018-x>`_. To start, ensure ``cellpose`` has been installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cellpose

Approach
********

.. figure:: cell_segmentation.png

The general approach for cell detection and segmentation in Slideflow is illustrated above, and will be discussed in the following sections. In short, the general approach is to tune the cell segmentation parameters on a single slide, use these parameters to detect cells in all of your slides, then extract cell images at these locations.

Workbench Preview
*****************

Cellpose models have several configurable parameters which will affect the quality of your segmentation masks, namely the **pretrained model** and **cell diameter**. The best way to determine the optimal parameters to use for your dataset is through interactive visualization using :ref:`Workbench <workbench>`.

Start Workbench with Cellpose enabled by using the ``--cellpose`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m slideflow.workbench --cellpose

Control panel
-------------

You'll see a control panel on the left which is grayed out until a slide is
loaded. Load a slide by drag-and-drop, or with File -> Open Slide.... Once a slide is opened,
the cell segmentation control panel will become active.

.. figure:: https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow/raw/1.5.0/docs/_images/cellseg_workbench_panel.png

The left side of the control panel is used to customize the segmentation model (defaults to
'cyto2') and cell diameter (defaults to 10 microns). Selecting "Auto-detect diameter" then
clicking "Preview" will perform cell segmentation on the portion of the slide currently in view.

Once complete, the diameter text box will be updated with the detected cell diameter.
Once cell segmentation is complete, the "View controls" section of the control panel will
become active, allowing you to customize how cell segmentation is shown.

Viewing cell segmentations
--------------------------

.. figure:: https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow/raw/1.5.0/docs/_images/cellseg_workbench_masks.png

By default, cell segmentation masks are shown in cyan on a black background. The black
background can be removed by unchecking "Black BG". You can add a green dot at each
cell's detected centroid by selecting the "Centroid option." The "Alpha" slider controls
transparency for the mask overlay.

You can also choose to view the segmentation masks as outlines. The "Outline" button will
convert any masks currently in view to outlines, allowing you to more easily see how the
masks match cells visible on the slide.

.. figure:: https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow/raw/1.5.0/docs/_images/cellseg_workbench_outlines.png

Finally, the "gradXY" option will show the flow gradients calculated during cell segmentation.

.. figure:: https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow/raw/1.5.0/docs/_images/cellseg_workbench_flows.png

Preparing WSI segmentation
--------------------------

Once you are satisifed with a chosen model and cell diameter, set the cell diameter to a
manual value in microns. Once the cell diameter has been set, the middle control panel will
activate, allowing you to perform whole-slide segmentation.

The **Otsu threshold** option will perform strict Otsu's thresholding on the whole slide image,
only performing cell segmentation in non-background areas (reducing computational time).
You can preview the Otsu's thresholding algorithm by checking the **Slide filter** box in the
first control panel box. This option is disabled by default, as Otsu's thresholding does not
work well for all slides (particularly cytology slides).

The **Save flows** option saves gradients during cell segmentation, allowing you to generate
visualizations as shown with the **gradXY** option above. This is disabled by default, as
calculation requires high RAM usage and may not be practical on all systems.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 60 40

    * - When **Show advanced** is checked, additional options controlling the cell segmentation
        process are shown.

        **Window** controls the window size during cell segmentation; cell segmentation is performed
        on images of this pixel size and then stitched together. The **Tile** option permits further sub-
        tiling of each window, reducing GPU and CPU memory utilization.

        **Downscale** will scale down the final generated cell segmentation mask, reducing memory
        utilization (both RAM and disk). **Enable spawn workers** enables a multiprocessing technique that improves cell segmentation speed at the cost of higher RAM usage.

            :align: right

Running WSI segmentation
------------------------

Once you are satisifed with the settings, whole-slide cell segmentation can be initialized by
clicking **Segment**. You will see a notification in the bottom-right corner of the screen when
segmentation is complete. In the meantime, a progress bar will be shown in the terminal
along with ETA.

Exporting results
-----------------

Once segmentation is complete, masks can be saved to disk for later use with **Export**.
Masks are saved in \*.zip format, and can be loaded in Workbench with drag-and-drop.

Segmenting cells
****************

Single slide segmentation
-------------------------

Once the segmentation parameters have been determined, you can run segmentation for a single slide using :func:`slideflow.cellseg.segment_slide`.

.. code-block::

    import slideflow as sf
    from slideflow.cellseg import segment_slide

    segmentation = segment_slide(
        '.../slide.svs',
        model='cyto2',
        diam_um=10,
        ...
    )
    segmentation.save('...masks.zip')

Project-wide segmentation
-------------------------

Cell segmentation can also be performed automatically for all slides in a Slideflow project.
Cell segmentation masks (and associated cell centroids) are calculated for all slides in the project using :meth:`slideflow.Project.cell_segmentation`.

.. code-block::

    import slideflow as sf

    # Load a slideflow project
    P = sf.Project(...)

    # Perform cell segmentation
    P.cell_segmentation(
        model='cyto2',
        diam_um=10
    )

Relevant arguments for this function include:

- ``model`` : Cell segmentation model. All cellpose models are supported, including 'cyto',
  'cyto2', 'nuclei', and more.
- ``diam_um`` : Cell diameter, in microns.
- ``buffer`` : Path to a buffer, significantly speeds up segmentation if running from a HDD
  (same as P.extract_tiles())
- ``window_size`` : Integer. Defaults to 256. Increasing this to 512 will make things slightly
  faster, but will use a bit more GPU memory.
- ``downscale`` : Factor by which to downscale the masks, to save memory. Defaults to 1
  (no downscaling, full resolution). Downscale of 2 is a nice balance between memory
  size and fidelity.

Depending on the size of the slide, this may take between 5-25 minutes per slide.

Masks will be saved in the project subfolder ``masks/`` . As described above,
these masks can be loaded in Workbench for interactive visualization via drag-and-drop.
They can also be used for downstream analysis and cell extraction, as described in the next
section.

Accessing segmentation masks
----------------------------

Saved cell segmentation masks (in \*.zip format) can be loaded with :class:`slideflow.cellseg.Segmentation`.

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.cellseg import Segmentation
    seg = Segmentation.load('.../slide-masks.zip')

The mask array, ``Segmentation.masks`` , is a ``np.ndarray`` with dtype of np.uint32. Zero values are background, and masks for each cell are represented by a unique integer. Flows/gradients,
if calculated, will be available in ``Segmentation.flows``.

Centroids for detected cells can be calculated with Segmentation.centroids(), returning an array of centroid locations. By default, coordinates are returned in mask dimension space. With the argument ``wsi_dim=True``, centroid coordinates will be in the slide dimension space.

Caveats
-------

There are some caveats to the cell segmentation process, including:

- **Memory usage**: Cell segmentation requires at minimum 32 GB of RAM. Larger slides (particularly cytology) may require up to 64 GB of RAM.
- **Stitching artifacts**: At present, due to the algorithm by which whole-slide cell segmentations are stitched together, you may see some cells that are not detected, missing in a grid-like pattern. Work is ongoing to reduce these stitching artifacts.
- **Cell diameter**: The quality of cell segmentation results is highly dependent on an appropriately chosen cell diameter. Use Workbench to find the best cell diameter for your application.

Extracting cells from slides
****************************

Once segmentation masks have been calculated, images of individual cells can be extracted from a whole-slide image. This can be performed for either a single slide, or all slides in a project.

From a single slide
-------------------

Start by loading the saved segmentation, as described above. Then, use :meth:`slideflow.WSI.apply_segmentation`, followed by :meth:`slideflow.WSI.extract_cells`.

.. code-block:: python

    import slideflow as sf
    from slideflow.cellseg import Segmentation

    # Load WSI.
    wsi = sf.WSI('../slide.svs', tile_px=96, tile_um='40x')

    # Load cell segmentations.
    seg = Segmentation.load('.../slide-masks.zip')

    # Apply segmentations to the slide.
    wsi.apply_segmentation(seg)

    # Extract images of cells.
    wsi.extract_cells(tiles_dir=...)


.. list-table::
    :widths: 80 20

    * - By default, segmentation masks will be applied to the extracted cell images:

      - .. image:: cell_masked.png

    * - However, you can choose not to apply masks by using the argument ``apply_masks=False``.


      - .. image:: cell_unmasked.png

Tile extraction is then performed as usual. Cell images (tiles) can either be saved as loose images or in TFRecord format. See :meth:`slideflow.WSI.extract_cells` for more information.

From all slides
---------------

Additionally, cell images can be extracted from all slides in a project. This should only be
done after :meth:`slideflow.Project.cell_segmentation`.

.. code-block:: python

    P.extract_cells(
        tile_px=96,
        tile_um='40x',
        apply_masks=True
    )

Extracted cell images are saved by default in TFRecord format, and are otherwise handled
identically to tile images generated through :meth:`slideflow.Project.extract_tiles`.

Complete example
****************

An example of a complete cell segmentation pipeline is shown below, from parameter tuning
to final tile extraction from detected cells.

1. Workbench
------------

Determine optimal cell segmenation parameters using Workbench, as described above:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m slideflow.workbench --cellpose

2. Cell segmentation
--------------------

Segment cells for all slides in a Slideflow project.

.. code-block:: python

    P = sf.Project(...)
    P.cell_segmentation(
        model='cyto2',
        diam_um=10,
        window_size=512,
        downscale=2
    )

3. Cell image extraction
------------------------

Extract image tiles of segmented cells, in this case using segmentation masks.

.. code-block:: python

    P.extract_cells(
        tile_px=96,
        tile_um='40x',
        apply_masks=True,
        grayspace_fraction=1
    )
